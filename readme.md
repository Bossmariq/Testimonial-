# Testimonial Grid

Testimonial Grid project from my Tailwind course (Tailwind CSS From Scratch | Learn By Building Projects ) and from Frontend Mentor Challenge

fontFamily: ["Barlow Semi Condensed"],

colors: Tailwind-purple-700
Tailwind-gray-600
Tailwind-white
Tailwind-gray-900

On this website we have one container with 6 child boxes (Box 3 is hidden on small screens and shows on medium screens and up while box 6 shows on only small screens. They are pretty much the same thing):

<!-- Some classes worthy of note that i used in this project -->

I used the grid system classes to align these boxes and span them (either rows or columns) the way i want

I used the ring class, it gave it like a border around it and i could color it using the ring color class

i used the line clamp class to reduce the number of text line that appears or that is visible

This is a simple project that was used to help me gain practical knowledge especially on the grid classes
